# My resume web page
Simple 'portofolio like' static responsive website with basic `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`.

## Sections
+ **Hero section** : a brief introduction with links to my github, linkedin and contacts
+ **About me** : a short description of who I am and what I do
+ **Skills** : a list of my skills
+ **Resume** : a list of my Certifications, Education and Professional Experience

I built this site using a modified version of [MyResume template](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/).
